# Mutable Iterator Borrowing Error in Rust

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with mutable iterators and borrowing. The code attempts to modify an element within a vector using a mutable iterator, leading to a borrowing conflict and a runtime panic.

## The Problem

Rust's borrowing rules are crucial for memory safety.  This example violates those rules by holding a mutable borrow on the entire vector `v` through the `iter_mut()` and simultaneously attempting to mutate a specific element within that vector using dereferencing and assignment.  

## Solution

The provided solution illustrates how to correctly handle this scenario either through indexing or by consuming the iterator's element and replacing it appropriately.
